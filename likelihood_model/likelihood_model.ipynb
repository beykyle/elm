    "## Setting up a likelihood model for cross sections\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a very simple likelihood model with no correlations between data points. The assumption is that each data point $(x_i,y_i)$ in the evidence is sampled independently from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(y_i^{\\rm{true}}, \\sigma_i)$, where $\\sigma_i$ is the experimentally reported statistical error. We will also include a fractional uncorrelated error to \"regularize\" our covariance matrix, $\\eta$. This models the physical model prediction with \"true\" parameters $y_m(x_i;\\alpha^{\\rm{true}})$ as varying according to $\\mathcal{N}( y_i^{\\rm{true}}, \\eta y_m(x_i;\\alpha^{\\rm{true}}) )$, that is, even for the best-fit parameters, the form of the model itself introduces some approximations that we model as having an error of a fraction $\\eta$ of the value of the model prediction. This is sometimes called \"un-accounted for uncertainty\". In this model, the log-likelihood will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}(\\alpha | y) \\equiv \\sum_i \\frac{ (y_i - y_m(x_i; \\alpha))^2}{\\sigma_i^2 + \\eta^2 y_m^2(x_i; \\alpha) }\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, following [KDUQ](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.107.014602), we will choose $\\eta = 0.3$ for all reactions. In KDUQ, they actually fit $\\eta$ and find results in the range 0.2-0.5 or so for elastic scattering differential cross sections for $(n,n)$ and  $(p,p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-hanging fruits for improving this likelihood model are fitting $\\eta$, including a description of systematic error in the normalization of each experimennt, and handling outliers."
